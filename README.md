# New York Taxi Fare Prediction using Neural Networks ðŸš•
This project focuses on predicting taxi fares in New York City using Neural Networks.

# Dataset
The dataset contains historical records of taxi rides in New York City with attributes: 'key' (unique identifier for each record), 'fare_amount' (target variable - the taxi fare amount to predict), 'pickup_datetime' (timestamp of the ride), 'pickup_longitude' and 'pickup_latitude' (coordinates of the pickup location), 'dropoff_longitude' and 'dropoff_latitude' (coordinates of the drop-off location), and 'passenger_count' (number of passengers in the taxi).

# Model Evaluation
The performance of various Neural Network Models is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), and  mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) to measure the accuracy of the fare amount predictions.

# Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries and tools:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
